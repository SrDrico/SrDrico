- 👋 Hi, I’m Adriano Leone, but you can just call me @SrDrico
- 👀 I’m interested in making games on roblox and other platforms
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javaScript, and soon, lua!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my own group of devs developing some projects, but for now i'm just going to learn how to code.
- 📫 How to reach me: you can pin me in my discord: Sr Drico#4107 or my gmail: adrianoleone200@gmail.com
